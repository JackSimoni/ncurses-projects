# Interactive Environment, Character Movement, and Choices:
Created an initial menu screen that lets you deploy the game. After this, you are introduced to the character Sevarian who you can control. The game employs map itneraction by allowing the player to enter through a trapdoor, which upon doing, displays text of an important event.
